It has improved dynamic applications, new CSS features that offer more control over your design, you can turn individual CSS properties on and off (you can see how they affect your designs), and you can fuse box model elements to troubleshoot directly within Dreamweaver.

Recently I have been trying to learn industry CSS standards and had heard that Dreamweaver has made great advances in CSS management in CS4 and CS5. I'm embarrassed to say what version I am using.\\n\\nWhen I got a chance to get a reviewer copy of this training set I jumped for two reasons, first I was mulling over spending the money to upgrade to DW CS5 and I second I have always that I was missing out on a lot of DW's capabilities.  It's now obvious that I should upgrade for the CSS management upgrades alone.\\n\\nAs for the value of the training - I couldn't be happier.  This is not an advanced tips and tricks resource, nor is it an exhaustive boot camp in web page authoring, but it is a fairly thorough training taking you from site planning and design to creation and publishing.  I watched the videos from beginning to end and they start pretty basic with an HTML refresher then move to the meatier DW specific training.  I can see myself returning to several sections later to brush up.\\n\\nPersonally, the CSS, Media, and Forms training videos were enough to justify the price tag.  The training lessons were short and easily digestible.  I liked that it broke training into 3-10 minutes so I had some time to do a little more in-depth googling on subjects like text wrapping on absolute positioned CSS objects (which it won't.) or checking my version of DW.\\n\\n  What this is\\n  - An Adobe Certification Training Aid - so it starts from a very low level introduction and  goes through the entire DW web creation process\\n  - A wonderfully designed interface\\n  - A great overview of using DW\\n\\nWhat it isn't\\n  - A substitute for spending the time working with DW (but it will jump start a novice)\\n  - An expert tips and tricks reference\\n\\nAll in all, I highly recommend this to anyone trying to learn DW or even web design in general. The CSS placement section has been the most enlightening coverage of the topic I have been able to find.  The author's delivery on the videos is great and the interface is the best, most intuitive I have seen. The only bad thing I can say is that the closed captioning is defaulted on, so at times it covered the bottom of the properties table at the bottom of the screen. So sometimes I had to close it to see things the author was pointing out.

So there you have it, do you get an advanced lesson that flies through things and most find it hard to understand, or do you get this one and appreciate the fact that she walks you through everything step by step, even at the risk of boring the more in the know people, but finally arriving at the section you need to learn, and then appreciate that she is not moving at lightning speed.\\n\\nI\\'m holding off buying Dreamweaver CS5, although I got the upgrade to Photoshop CS5 and love it, because my MX2004 is not an eligible upgrade version. If I could qualify for the upgrade I would grab it, but the learning curve of CSS, and the steep price for the full version when I have MX2004 already is giving me some hesitation.

I\\'m in the process of trying to work more professionally (cleaner, less, and better code) and more creatively (a less stilted and more unique and appealing design). This course doesn\\'t purport to be a web design course, it assumes that you already have a basic idea for a (relatively simple) website and it\\'s going to teach you how to implement it. Don\\'t expect inspiration.\\n\\nPOSITIVE:\\n* Level: absolute beginner to intermediate.\\n*  It is entirely DVD-based. The booklet (106 pages including index) that comes with the DVD just provides additional random information; it is in no way connected to the content or the sequence of the course.\\n* The scope of the information presented is all that is needed for basic competence in the implementation of a simple Dreamweaver CS5 website. You do become familiar with the DW interface; the workflow; best practices; web and DW terminology; and basic website structure and creation.\\n* The sequence and progression is logical and sequential. There is some reiteration of basic principles as the course progresses to clarify how something previously explained applies in a new situation.\\n* The interface is very well thought out. You can go backwards or forwards easily. It has constant access to a table of contents that allows you to search (by both topic and subtopics) in case you want to navigate to a completely different topic. It allows you to bookmark (with long notes-to-self) on topics of interest you may want to keep coming back to. The interface coloring and design are neutral and un-intrusive. The screen always retains focus and the surrounding options melt away.\\n* The course has the secondary purpose of preparing for the Adobe Certified Expert (ACE) test. Each main section has a practice test at the end.\\n* Another asset is that the video transcript is captioned under the viewing screen (optional). This is particularly helpful if you\\'re in in a public place where you can\\'t turn on the sound.\\n* All explanations of hard-to-grasp concepts (ex: the box model) are clearly demonstrated with visual examples. As a matter of fact, this is the clearest explanation I have ever seen of the box model.\\n* I did find the booklet section on Fireworks instructive, since I have never used that program in the past. In fact, the entire booklet is very instructive and useful--it\\'s just totally unrelated to the course on DVD.\\n\\nNOT SO POSITIVE:\\n* Coverage of other concepts, such as content placement and positioning, are a little more basic and less detailed than I would have liked. I can\\'t recall (or locate now) any reference to floats, whereas AP divs and frames (both older concepts) are well covered.\\n* The narrator has a pleasant voice and clear diction, but is somewhat monotone and unexciting.\\n* There is no \"search\" function or \"index.\" This makes it impossible to look up a term or a topic that is not specifically listed in the table of contents. I would have thought that the transcript text might have been searchable, but it isn\\'t.\\n* For my learning style, I would have preferred that the booklet function as support material for the video so I could follow along with text that directly reinforces the visual demonstration (and is easier to go back to or use as reference material.)\\n* The bookmarks that you create when taking the course on your laptop are saved to that computer. If you want to change to your desktop, the bookmarks, obviously, are not there. So as a \"personal index\" these bookmarks have their limits.\\n\\nOn the whole, I do recommend this course. I wish I had taken it earlier, because it laid down the groundwork better than an online course that I had just taken. However, I think that, for a person who is learning-as-you-go (not just learning general theory but actually trying to apply it to a real website) it is essential to have reference material on Dreamweaver CS5, some sort of guidance on design principles, and a solid HTML and CSS anthology--all in well-indexed books.\\n\\nVideo and online courses teach you very well how to build their sample websites, but when you are stumped on YOUR website, you need to be able to supplement the general principles they taught you with a more on-point reference.', 'summary': 'Competent introduction to Dreamweaver and web principles.'}]}\n",

I\\'d worked through the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Adobe-Flash-Professional-CS5-Classroom-in-a-Book/dp/0321701801/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Adobe Flash Professional CS5 Classroom in a Book</a>&nbsp;- and found that to be more comprehensive in its coverage, but there is a different emphasis here and I found I learned quite a bit that I didn\\'t know or that wasn\\'t clear before.  The little booklet that comes with the guide is an extremely useful introduction to design principles that are essential to effective working in Flash.\\n\\nThere are several chapters on different introductory-level topics in Flash CS5.  Each is broken up into different sections, and usually these can be completed in under ten minutes each.  That makes this easy to work through in short sections.  You can set bookmarks to remember where you left off - although it would be nicer if the program saved your progress directly and remembered for you where you left off.  The exposition is clear, but perhaps a bit dry.  There\\'s no hint of humor here, and I always find it helps to make verbal lessons a bit more interesting and memorable.  Each section tells you what you are going to learn, gives you an explanation and a tutorial you can follow along using one of the project files included on the dvd, and then explains what you have learned.\\n\\nThe focus here is on learning how things work and what things mean at a fairly basic level.  You don\\'t get very advanced, and by the end of things you\\'d really just have a rough idea of how things work in Flash, but it is very clear.  They assume a listener who is just getting started with Flash, and, while the lessons are sequential and they build upon each other, they remind you what you\\'ve learned and how to do things several times.  Sometimes that\\'s a bit frustrating - in a beginner\\'s level textbook it\\'s easy just to skim through the repetition when it is familiar - with video it\\'s harder to skim through what is inessential without missing the important bits.  That\\'s one reason to prefer something like the \"Classroom in a Book\" series, rather than the Video Classroom approach.\\n\\nOne thing I got here more clearly than in the \"Classroom in a Book\" for Flash CS5 is an emphasis on best practices - how to manage projects so as to be completely clear, and how that helps to achieve control over the project.  There is more explanation here - more whys behind the hows.  I thought the chapter on Action Script was excellent for giving a clear concept of how it works as an \"object based\" language - even though you\\'d only be able to do some very rudimentary things after working through the entire chapter, you\\'d have a pretty decent understanding of how the language works and a good basis for further learning.  There are video files on the disk that allow you to follow along on what they show you in the tutorials.  One thing they don\\'t make clear is that to work with them you have to copy the assets folder to your hard drive and open and work with the projects there.  (I find it most convenient to backup the entire dvd to my hard drive and play it from there - since that means it\\'s available and ready whenever I want to work through a section, and it also helps to protect the original disk from scratching).\\n\\nOverall, it\\'s a good introduction to Flash and the emphasis on \"Best Practices\" serves as a useful complement to the \"how to\" guides you can find in other introductory Flash books.  I do have a few minor gripes:  the navigation through the chapter files is not as intuitive as I\\'d like: there are sections and subsections, and you can go to the next section in a chapter by clicking the \"Next Video\" button.  But: when you get to the end of a subsection, the \"Next Video\" button is not enabled and you have to go back to the main index and then open up the chapter index again to get to the next section in the chapter.  Several words in the projects are misspelt (e.g. \"Hawaiin\" instead of \"Hawaiian\"), and I also noticed that at least one of the project files they encourage you to use was missing (the \"inverseKinematics_start.fla\" file from chapter 9).  Still, the guide as a whole is very helpful and clear - and the emphasis on design principles in the included booklet makes this a very helpful overview and introduction to a rich and complicated program.', 'summary': 'A helpful introduction to Flash CS5 - a bit dry, perhaps, but very clear and useful explanations and great on \"best practices\"'}]}\n",

You\\'ll learn the fundamentals; you won\\'t learn how to create those fancy user interfaces on those fancy sites; that\\'s for a more advanced class.\\n\\nAs with other products in this series, there are some usability issues. At the top of the interface, there\\'s a \"Previous Video\" button and \"Next Video\" button. The \"Next Video\" button is disabled for the last video of each chapter, so to get to the next one you\\'ll have to use other navigation. This is because the last item is the test. Kinda dumb UI choice, initially confusing. They could have changed it to read \"Take Test\" instead of putting up a virtual dead end. There is a sidebar which is normally hidden (you are cued that you can display it when the mouse strays into the video area), which has information on the current video and lists/links to the other videos in the chapter. The title bar (under the top-left tabs) is a dropdown to navigate the content.\\n\\nThere\\'s a \"Watch and Work\" mode which shrinks the video display to let you work with your copy of DreamWeaver (not included). You can move the video window around BUT you CANNOT resize it - and it may be kind of tiny to watch in that mode. So if you have a dual monitor setup, you\\'ll want to drag the Standard Mode video player to the other screen; Standard Mode cannot be resized to be smaller, either.\\n\\nAll in all it\\'s a good way to get started in Flash programming, if you don\\'t have the patience for going through a book.

In the long run, Office 365 is a better deal than buying a downloadable, installable product--because you *get* a downloadable, installable product with this deal.\\n\\nSo what exactly are you getting here?\\n\\nThis package is the ability to use the latest version of Office in the browser--meaning, if you\\'re on a machine that doesn\\'t have Office installed, you can log into your Microsoft account (required) and use browser-based versions of all the Office apps.  This also means that the online storage place called \"OneDrive\" (formerly known as \"SkyDrive\") can be used to store up to one TeraByte (1,000GB) of stuff, anything you like, private or public or just shared out as you wish.\\n\\nIt\\'s ALSO the ability to download and install Office 2013 OR Office 2016, on up to 5 machines, for up to 4 people!  That\\'s the cool part.  In the past, you might have to buy more than one copy of Office, or be the sole user, or only put it on a desktop and a laptop.  Now I can put this on my desktop, laptop, and Surface Pro, then install it on my wife\\'s PC and my daughter can also have a copy installed to use.  I\\'ve been running Office 2016 for the most part and have been pretty happy with the way it works.  2016 is not hugely different from 2013 or 2010, just in little ways.\\n\\nThis package lets you use Office for a year.  You can buy two or three and stack them to prolong your subscription (if you\\'re afraid the price of Office will go up) or you can extend your subscription to more people (in case you have a bunch of kids and want to add mom and dad and grandma into the number of users).  I added a year using this code.  It was only easy to do because I looked online first for HOW to do it.\\n\\nWhich brings us to the only real drawback to Office 365:  anything to do with the browser.  The browser-based apps try to be as much like the desktop as possible, but they\\'re still not quite the same.  OneNote is probably the closest match I\\'ve seen, while Outlook is the ugliest and least useful.  The fact that the browser-based versions run in Azure (\"the Cloud\", a.k.a., \"on the Internet\") means that they typically run a bit slower, depending on your Internet connection.  OneDrive is more annoying to manage using the browser, so I find myself using a computer to do most of the work like uploading files/folders, creating new folders, etc.  I use the browser-based OneDrive interface to download individual stuff or share stuff out to people.  The entire browser interface is trying to do the \"Kanban\" look that you also see in Windows 8\\'s \"Metro-now-called-Modern\" apps and parts of Windows 10\\'s look and feel.\\n\\nMy rule of thumb is that the browser-based Office is for small tasks on the go, but for anything substantial I go with the PC.\\n\\nYou also have to use the Office website to mange things like who you share Office with, or how you download.  They make it annoyingly over-complicated to download the 64-bit version of Office if you don\\'t want to use the 32-bit.  You have to choose \"Install-->Language and Install Options-->Additional Install Options--> then pick the specific 64-bit version you want.  There\\'s no good reason to bury the better-performing version that far down except that they hope it prevents tech support complications.\\n\\nThe Home Subscription is: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Outlook, and a 1TB bump-up to OneDrive, up to 4 people across 5 machines.\\nThe Personal Subscription is the same, but only for one individual user, on up to 5 machines.\\nThe Business version has a lot of other options *and* things to consider when choosing.\\n\\nOverall, I find this a much better deal than shelling out a few hundred dollars up front and knowing the next version will require me to buy it again, and I don\\'t get the benefit of the added OneDrive storage space.  With this price, it\\'s cheaper and I will always have the option of downloading the latest version of Office or sticking with the one I have.  The browser-based versions I consider an afterthought, or \"bonus feature\" - I wouldn\\'t rely solely on those for everyday work.  And I would like to see managing the subscriptions and installs get a bit easier.', 'summary': 'Times have changed'}]}\n",

There are pros and cons for the user here - since it\\'s basically cloud-delivered, you don\\'t need to worry about holding physical discs or keys; you can more easily use it on multiple devices (including Microsoft tablets - sorry iOS/Android users); you don\\'t pay for it longer than you need it.  This model could work well for apps with specific uses that would otherwise be overly expensive, e.g. Photoshop (Adobe also rolled this SaaS plan out earlier this year to much anguish).  However, for the basic word processing, spreadsheet and presentation uses that most people look to Office for, this model could actually turn out to be more expensive in the long run.  Put another way, most people are likely using a version of Office that is many years old and that\\'s still fine for their simple uses - that Word 2007 (or even 97!) that you purchased for perpetuity still lets you type, format and print those handful of letters that you need to create each year.  So I believe that only power users of Word, Excel and/orPowerPoint and/or homes with multiple PCs would really benefit from the SaaS pricing model.  Others will likely be frustrated when forced to fork over another $99 (unless the cost goes up, which there are no guarantees that it won\\'t) every 12 months.

Simply put, I don\\'t feel that these newer versions of Office enable me to be as productive or creative as I had been with past versions.  I know that I\\'m not alone in this view, but unfortunately it seems that Microsoft is more focused on their SaaS profit model and shoehorning in touch screen gimmicks (as if everyone will then run out and buy a touch-screen PC, upgrade to Windows 8, and/or grab a Surface tablet).', 'summary': \"Yep - You're Renting Office Now - Get Used to It!\"}]}\n",

But innovation as a way of creating a false impression of progress to mask a need to perpetually carve out market share is vile, and it has long driven Microsoft's business plan and service model. But two other marks of Microsoft has been its attempt corner a portion of the market, give the consumer no real alternative, and then force them to pay through the nose, meanwhile making it harder and harder to use previously purchased versions of the product. And to complete my portrait of the Microsoft that I hated to like, Microsoft had an absolutely dreadful customer service department. Not that Customer Service was inept, but merely unavailable. And turning the old department store adage on its head, not only was the customer never right, they were most likely very much wrong.\\n\\nAs a result, Microsoft had over time created a way of doing business that was out of touch with the needs of the customer. Indeed, I had come to dislike Microsoft so much that I stuck with my old copy of Office 2000 for years longer thatn I had any desire to. But I was not going to pay an absurd amount of money for a piece of software that they were only going to allow me to put onto one device, and that was not going to be supported by technical support.\\n\\nSo imagine my shock when I found myself something of a fan of their new way of doing business. Instead of being prohibitively expensive, Office 365 is reasonably priced. You pay less than $80 for a key to unlock a download on up to five devices. Or if $80 is too pricey, you can pay just under ten dollars a month for the same five-device key. And unlike in the past, when you paid a large amount of money for a single-user key to Office Lite (the Student Edition was essentially Word and Excel, while the subscription grants you the use of more Office programs, including Outlook, PowerPoint, Access, Publisher, and One Note. What was once a prohibitively expensive suite of programs suddenly became very reasonably priced (no doubt in part because pirated editions meant that instead of paying an absurd amount of money to Microsoft, people would simply go to a Torrent site and get a free copy of Office).\\n\\nAnd to make everything even more impressive, Microsoft's customer service is more accessible than ever. I had a particularly difficult installation due to preinstalled trial editions of Office 365 on my new computers. Microsoft worked with me at length to make sure Office 365 installed properly on all of my devices. Not just that, but when I expressed the wish to use my Hotmail e-mail address on Outlook, they escalated the problem to a higher level tech support person.\\n\\nNow, that doesn't mean that this is a perfect product. I have not liked the direction that Office has taken since Office 2007. And Microsoft still fails to include a crackerjack WYSIWYG HTML editor. But all in all I'm impressed with the nontechnical aspects of Office 365. And I have to admit that it is kind of fun having at least portions of Office installed on my desktop, my lap top, my smart phone, and my tablet. In a family with multiple computer owners, it should be possible for each family member to have a full version of Office installed on their computer. I'm still not a huge fan of Microsoft, but I'm delighted to see them make their products more consumer-friendly.\", 'summary': 'A kinder, gentler Microsoft'}]}\n",

One positive feature of Office 365 is the SkyDrive which enables you to save your documents and projects to the cloud and access them from other locations. I also like that 365 makes it possibly to easily collaborate on projects by inviting others to access the document. The other person does not have to have the same version of Office that you do, it can pull up the document in a browser and they can view and make changes as needed. You can also work on SkyDrive documents when you're offline and then they'll update when you have an internet connection again (BUT if the document was updated at another location and you don't have internet access, then you won't be accessing the most up-to-date version, which I view as a bit of a liability.) I have been known to save important documents to both my SkyDrive and my computer just as a back-up in case the Internet gods decide to shut up the data heavens.\\n\\nAn added feature of Office 365 is access to Office Mobile Apps. Unfortunately, my smartphone (HTC Desire) is not compatible with the Office Mobile App and so I can't make use of the mobile features. However, the subscription does include the option of adding up to five mobile devices (but I imagine they have to be fairly recent mobile devices or you might run into the problem I had of the device being incompatible with the app). I was kind of bummed that it won't work on my device. It would have been convenient to be able to access my documents on the go, but oh well, what can you do.\\n\\nInstallation is fairly easy. You just go to the website, enter the product key and connect it to your Microsoft account (or you can start an account with any e-mail address). It will let you download the software on up to five computers, BUT as the name Office 365 indicates, you will only have access to the software for 365 days. After that point you will have to pay all over again for another year's access to the software. The positives of that is that you will always have the most up-to-date Office software (automatic updates are included in the subscription), but the obvious con is that you'll be perpetually paying for a subscription. Honestly, my personal preference would be just to own the software outright (I'm OK with not having the latest and greatest version). They do throw in a few extra perks to help lessen the pain of an annual subscription: Skype 60 minutes a month world calling & SkyDrive with 20 GB storage.\\n\\nIt did take a little while for the program to download, but if you have any experience with Office products, it is pretty easy to find your way around. I do like that you have the option of downloading on up to five computers and five mobile devices, but you do have to be prepared to repay for the right to access the software annually. If you're OK with that, then I think you'll enjoy Office 365. It's user-friendly and helps bring accessible technology to our society that's increasingly mobile and connected. I like that my documents can go with me wherever I am.\", 'summary': 'Annual expense, but some neat benefits'}]}\n",

It wasn\\'t always this way, as those who have been computer users for some years will remember well. In fact, we may have all been running WordPerfect Office with its affiliated programs if it wasn\\'t for some strange twists in computer history beginning in the 1990s.\\n\\nThere are a number of variations of this Microsoft Office suite that can be found here, but this review is specifically focused on&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Office-365-Home-Premium/dp/B009SPTUW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Office 365 Home Premium</a>. This version is is a one-year subscription downloaded from \\'Net by entering a product key card, and is licensed for up to five users on PCs, Windows 8 tablets, and Macs (with some limitations - see the specs). It offers the current versions of Word, Outlook, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote. Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Publisher, Access and more.\\n\\nPlease note: I had previously installed the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Office-Home-Business-2013-Key-Card-1PC-1User/dp/B009SPWJ98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Office Home & Business 2013 Key Card 1PC/1User</a>&nbsp;version on a Window 7 PC notebook, and that version had worked quite well. The annual subscription to Office 365 Home Premium became a worthy option for a new PC running Windows 8 as a development/test system for both hardware and software, so when it came to making a decision as to which suite to go with, curiosity won out.\\n\\nHere are the highly-subjective likes and dislikes found so far with this installation of the new Office 365 Home Premium suite for those looking for just the key points, then followed with some expanded details.\\n\\n Likes:\\n\\n+ Very smooth installation; simple directions, easy to follow, almost effortless\\n+ Clean interface; smooth and minimalist, ribbon can be collapsed as needed\\n+ Operates on five PCs or Macs; license for single household with multiple users\\n+ Excellent Outlook integration; works well with Outlook.com, Gmail and private email\\n+ SkyDrive; allows for access of files on the cloud, file sharing when needed\\n+ Easy customization once installed; make it work your way\\n\\n Rants & Irritants:\\n\\n- Full ALL CAPS menu tabs; don\\'t like having the Metro-style jammed down my throat\\n\\n Installation:\\n\\nThe setup is simple and easy to follow. Included in the small box are the directions and a 25-character Product Key card. Go to the Microsoft Office site as indicated, enter the characters from the card as noted, then sign into or create your Microsoft account. Users who already have an Outlook account (possibly converted over from Hotmail) can start with that. Then it\\'s a simple scenario of following the on-screen directions, and the entire installation should be finished in under 30 minutes.\\n\\nFound the interface to be much cleaner than my older Office 2007 running on another older computer, and with the exception of the CAPS ON menu tabs noted above, it was a good improvement. Though I did not do any precise stopwatch timings, Office 365 seemed to load faster and smoother. The ribbon menu can be collapsed or expanded as needed. When you open up Word, Excel, PowerPoint or Publisher, you\\'ll find a selection of templates on the left side of the screen instead of just a blank document, which is just an extra click away.\\n\\nWhat follows are some subjective notes about the various components found within this Office 365 Home Premium suite. I won\\'t attempt to go too heavy into each of these as one could write a full review on most of the modules by themselves, but consider these as observations found from a few weeks use.\\n\\n SkyDrive:\\n\\nI like SkyDrive and have been using it for some time. This has been integrated quite well within Office 365 Home Premium, and has built in resilience against jittery Internet connections. Should you should lose your connectivity while working on a file opened from a SkyDrive account, Office 365 saves it temporarily on your local hard drive before synchronizing with SkyDrive at a later point in time. And what is good is that it syncs quite well so that you can retrieve/edit documents (or images) from other computers once you\\'re logged in.\\n\\n Word:\\n\\nThe features for Word have remained largely the same as those in Office 2007 and those that I\\'ve found working on clients\\' Office 2010 installations. Documents often need to be edited after they are written, and Word 2013 makes the editing process easier with such new features such as the ability to edit PDF files. Previously, you needed to install third-party software, such as Adobe Acrobat. This was available to those of us who have been running Word for Mac 2011 where it does a respectable job, but is new to the PC version. Have not had much time to play with it, but if it works as well as the Mac version, then this will be a big help.\\n\\nAmong the new additions that I\\'ve found are that you can watch embedded videos right there within the document, and without having to go to a different application. If you work with collaborative documents, you can reply within comments and those replies will be displayed in threaded conversation style.\\n\\n Excel:\\n\\nOn a personal note, I have had a love/hate relationship with spreadsheet programs in general since the days of Microsoft Multiplan and Lotus 1-2-3, both of which are distant history now. That being said, Excel has been a program of choice for years now, and one that I\\'ve used to input table data into Word and as a flat file database for quite some time. Entering data into spreadsheets can be a tedious and boring chore, so the downward fill feature in Excel that allows you automatically fill the cells in each row with the same number by dragging down has been an ally.\\n\\nBut now there\\'s a new Flash Fill feature that recognizes patterns in your data functions, then automatically fills in the rest of the spreadsheet, and complex formulas are not necessary. You can make it automatically format names the same way (such as last, first, middle initial) just by giving it some examples. Phone numbers can be converted to a uniform format, such as (212) 555-1212, and restore the leading zero to zip codes is a breeze. Look for the Flash Fill button on the Data tab and try it. It\\'s well worth it.\\n\\n OneNote:\\n\\nThis is probably one of the most overlooked and underrated components of the Office suites. First encountered it in Office 2007, and it became a handy way to keep simple notes and such, but it was limited. The new version will allow you to embed Excel spreadsheets and see the preview within your note. When you update the spreadsheet, the preview automatically updates, as well. Searching within OneNote is better, as you can now search for words that are embedded in graphics files.\\n\\n PowerPoint:\\n\\nThere\\'s a new, cleaner look to PowerPoint. You can start a new presentation using a theme, a template, an older presentation or a more recent one, as well as a blank one. New users should find PowerPoint 2013 to be more intuitive than older versions, and those who are experienced PowerPoint pros will find that everything seems to go smoother. I pulled up some old presentations, including one that was from the late 1990s, and found that doing a few edits was a very smooth process. The themes now come with variations, so tightening up on the look you want is simpler.\\n\\n Outlook:\\n\\nThere\\'s an openness to this upgraded version. Outlook is a powerful module, but it will take new users a bit of time to learn to navigate among all of the functions and to understand the numerous toolbar icons, as I found out when showing mine to a colleague. I\\'ve been using Outlook under Office for Mac 2011 on a MacBook Pro, and never had an issue with Outlook on the OS X platform. I\\'m currently trying to sync the two versions as much as possible.\\n\\n Publisher:\\n\\nI personally use Publisher infrequently at this point. Like the other modules in Office 365, you\\'ll find a selection of templates on the left side of the screen instead of just a blank document.\\n\\n Access:\\n\\nThe Office Access relational database management system was a product that at one time was a favorite when I was converting over from dBase III many years ago. Speaking honestly, I have not accessed this module, and pardon the pun.\\n\\n Annoyances & Irritants:\\n\\nMy primary gripe with the new Office suites has to do with the full ALL CAPS menu tabs, and I\\'m trying my best to see if I can learn to adapt or if I\\'ll change it. As noted earlier, I don\\'t like the \"new\" Microsoft Metro style being jammed down my throat without the option to change it easily. It\\'s essentially the same one that we find on the Office pages on the Web. There is a workaround, but it must be done in each individual Office 2013 module that you use: go to File > Options > Customize Ribbon, then use the Rename button on each one of the main menu items listed in the right pane under Customize the Ribbon. Instead of changing the name, however, add a space to the end of the name, and then click OK. When you return to the Home tab, the ribbon menu items will be displayed in a title case, with only the first letter capitalized. You can also go back to the ALL CAPS default by resetting them.\\n\\n Suggestions:\\n\\nPutting this simply, if you\\'re happy with Office 2007 or 2010, you may want to weigh your choices between the various versions here, read some of the reviews that best apply to your own needs, then decide whether you wish to keep the earlier version or go for the upgrade. My decision to try Office 365 was based on the fact that it was going to be a \\'clean\\' install on a new Windows 8 PC and that I had a year to use it and see if it was worth the subscription, or if it might be better to go with a \\'regular\\' license for another version. My installation went smoothly and it works well; your results may differ from mine.\\n\\nI have not tried an installation on a Windows 7 PC to date, but have been largely impressed with how well it runs on a standard, out-of-the-box Windows 8 PC. Please note: this review will be dynamic in that as I find experiences worth sharing, be they pro or con, they will be appended to this review. Other findings or additional resources may be listed in the comments.\\n\\n Summary:\\n\\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Office-365-Home-Premium/dp/B009SPTUW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Office 365 Home Premium</a>&nbsp;as a one year subscription for five users/computers has proven to be an interesting choice for my needs as noted in this review. Please keep in mind that with such a program, your needs and mine may differ, as we each use such office suites in different fashions. Currently I\\'ll rate this suite at a solid 4-star product that can be recommended on the Windows 8 platform.\\n\\n9/30/2013', 'summary': 'Office 365 Home Premium: Fast and functional'}]}\n",

As long as an account is setup before trying to downloading the product, it downloaded and installed easily for me. Yes, it took time. After all, this is a bloated Microsoft product. This version of Office is sort of a hybrid, or so it feels - partly in the cloud, but mostly on your computer. That it good for people on the go and need to access documents that may have been saved at different locations on different machines or devices. Documents can be saved to the Skydrive associated with your account. In order to use this program, unlike a standard office version, you must be logged into the account you created, or a previous account that can be linked to the subscription. The subscription includes free apps (must be downloaded from the app stores) for iPhone and I would imagine Android and Windows mobile as well, which allow viewing and editing documents as well as accessing the Skydrive from a mobile device (Don\\'t tell the boss about this).\\n\\nThe new look of Office 365 is more in line with Windows 8, but it is flat, colorless and dull. Microsoft does not give you many options to change it either. There are three different themes to choose from - White, Light Gray and Dark Gray. Wow! Microsoft really? I would at least have expected a light blue like Office 2007 offered. At least if White or Light Gray is chosen there is a thin line of color at the bottom status bar, with dark gray chosen this is black. The color changes based on the program being used - blue for Word, green for Excel, etc. There is also a background pattern that can be chosen which is really just in the top right hand corner of the screen. These uninteresting patterns are grey, but vary in shade based on the \"theme\" chosen. Pretty unexciting.\\n\\nAs far as functionality goes, Office hasn\\'t changed that much in the last few versions, there is a customizable ribbon at the top which changes based on the tab that is chosen. Microsoft has done away with any sort of shading or shadowing to make the ribbon stand out in any way, it is incredibly flat looking, which is kind of disconcerting, and at times confusing. Clicking on \"File\" (which for some reason always has a colored box around it) slides open another screen where there are other options. This is where more of a Windows 8 look comes into play (and a little bit more color). The options are pretty much the same as in other Windows versions, just presented differently. Save As offers an option to save to the computer as well as to the Skydrive. Microsoft installs a program that loads when the computer is started that keeps the Skydrive in sync with all the documents saved there. The icon in the computer\\'s toolbar is a cloud with a green line moving from left to right. Because it is constantly synching, there is a noticeable, but not intolerable lag when typing, as compared to a non-cloud based system.\\n\\nOffice 365 comes with a license for up to 5 PC\\'s or Macs which makes the $99.00 a year (at time the of review) price a good deal if utilizing all of them, since it offers the full Office suite, 20 GB storage on the Skydrive and 60 minutes of Skype per month all included in the subscription. It does not turn out to be such a good deal if it is only being used on one PC or Mac, in which case it might be better to get a non-subscription version which costs more upfront, but can be used until its obsolescence at no charge. The other versions offer the same features without the Skype credits and less storage space on the Skydrive. Windows 7 or 8 is required to run any new version of Microsoft Office product.\\n\\nMicrosoft Office is pretty much the world standard for software of this type. Other software has come and gone, so it is almost essential to own some version of Office these days. While Office 365 is not my favorite version that Microsoft has created, it\\'s not that bad either. The lack of color makes their product boring and hard to navigate, and because there is no option to change this is frustrating. Microsoft needs to put some style into its office products.', 'summary': 'A Lack Of Color Makes A Boring Interface'}]}\n",

You can install this five times on five different computers which means that if you split the costs with four others you end up paying less than $20 a year (though Microsoft won\\'t guarantee the price will be the same next year). You get the use of Office 365 days a year, with any improvements that transpire during that time.\\n\\nI like Office considerably, and this is basically Office 2013. Because I use Office a lot, I\\'m used to things that people get upset about. For instance, I feel very positive about the Ribbon which other people don\\'t like. I find it hard to recommend anything else, and as long as Microsoft keep offering this at a low price it\\'s a no-brainer.\\n\\nAll I dislike about this is the installation problem I\\'ve mentioned.

The only minor glitch was that I had to install Roxio first.  If you\\'ve never installed a program you may need a bit of guidance, but for anyone else installation is quite simple.

From my perspective, I have taken a lot of time to get used to the interface and explore the features.  As somebody who is admittedly not an expert in the subject matter, I find the interactive features to add new dimensions to the content that is presented.  And considering the amount of investment required to produce software of this caliber, I think this program is a great value.\\n\\nMany have reported installation problems.  For PC use, I can report that I had no problems installing this on Windows 7.  The program required that I install Microsoft .NET framework 4 first, and the related updates.  But as of November 2011, it seems like some of the installation problems have been fixed.\\n\\nThe initial install allows you to access the basic features, but you will need to register to use things like the Atlas.  The actual space required to install the software is about 1 GB for a PC and 200 MB for a Mac.  You can use the interface to stream the data off the internet, and while there is some lag it wasn\\'t significant for me.  But yes, if you want all the files on your local hard drive you will need to use all 3 disks and it will take up about 18 GBs.  That seems like a small price to pay for those who choose to have all the content stored locally.\\n\\nThis product is advertised to work for multiple devices.  While I had no problem with a PC install, it seems getting it to work on a tablet or iPod requires separate installs.  I will update this further once I confirm that my license key works for all the devices.\\n\\nThe best features for me are the Atlas, which integrates historical content from the Bible with geographical data and images.  This is the kind of resource that I think would be very valuable when visiting the various regions of Europe, Africa and the Middle East depicted in the Bible.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nThis is a very good program.  Though it takes some time to learn the interface, I think it\\'s worth the effort.  Enjoy.', 'summary': 'GLO - Great Interactive Software for Bible Education'}]}\n",

I enjoy reading the Bible for its historical information and have found over the years many different iterations of the Bible.

There is nothing quite as pleasant as sitting in front of a monitor and just going from verse to verse but having those verses explained in a way the layman can fully understand some of the background.  For comparison I have a 1810 version of The King James Bible that has been passed down from several generations and is quite used.  The words, however, come through and are the same.  The annotations for each page, where applicable, are similar to GLO's annotations except the time in years actually makes a difference.  That's a good thing and GLO does it well.  I was not prepared for the full range of information contained in the program and even though it slows the speed of my computer it is well worth the small wait.

There's so much to GLO...I'm still discovering stuff about it.\\n\\nGLO at its base offers the bible in five versions, an atlas, a timeline, topical, media, and a place for your stuff. Reading the bible on GLO is a joy. The pages are laid out beautifully - like a book displayed on a screen. Makes it easy to read. In the bottom you can view commentaries or add your own notes. You can also see notes that other have made via YouVersion. (Nice feature!) Also, it will display any media (video, pics, and more) that may be relevant to the part of the bible you're reading. If you right-click on bible passages, another sub-menu appears to copy it or take your study further.\\n\\nGLO's gorgeous screens reminds me Linux Ubuntu's darkly colorful Unity interface mixed with Apple's love of icons all in a unique interface package. Icons glow and grow, screens slide, all on a black background - except for when you're reading the bible. Your work sessions are recorded as icons you can return to. The different parts of the menu and program options are accessed on sliding tabs and icons. This is not a flat bible program - it's a 3D bible world that you are navigating through. Is visually exciting, but the possibility to get lost or wander is too easy as well.\\n\\nBe forwarned: you do need a very capable computer with a good amount of processing power.

I have a fully loaded and gorgeous program and no skills to how to use it to my benefit. I wish GLO had included a follow-along tutorial explaining all the different features, how they work together, and the different ways I can benefit from it.

It offers a stunningly beautiful interface and a tons of information and resources to draw from. It also offers the ability to link your information to an iPhone/iPad app so you can carry it around with you. The only drawback is that you do need a rather powerful computer to get the most out of it without lag or frustration.

I needed to use 'Help' to learn how to find my way around.\\n\\nAs a test,  I did a search for Galatians 5:22; first it turned up nothing, but then I did a search in Galatians & also on the home page both searches pulled up the verse, 2 photos and a map. Clicking on the verse took me to the Galations 5,  the highlighted Bible passage, study notes and a map. Clicking the photos brought up the photo, its description and other pertinent info.

Nolo makes (made) some valuable applications but they tend to look like something you would find in MSDOS 3.0.  Quicken, on the other hand has a very slick and easy to understand user interface.\\n\\nWillMaker Plus is very much a Nolo product. Although it contains the basic forms you buy it for, the user interface is so basic it looks like something you would find on PC\\'s from the 1980\\'s.  The willmaking app (the part that most people buy this for) consists of 7 questions.  Seriously, that\\'s it. You are allowed to enter only what the software will let you enter and there are some really basic non-interactive guidelines that are at the same time too basic and also too confusing.\\n\\nI wrote my own will in about 10 minutes, but the software didn\\'t permit me to include ANY specific details for someone to know what my \"final intentions\" are. I can\\'t imagine anyone having such a basic lifestyle as to just say \"give it all to so-and-so\".  I think anyone could just hand-write that sort of thing on a piece of paper and hand it to their next of kin.  I expected the software to be more like TurboTax in that it would interview me about what the provisions of my mortgage are, what and where my investments are, what and where my life insurance policies are, what I owe and how to pay that off, what special provisions I may have for friends who are not in my will but who I may want to leave certain things that they\\'ve admired to.

There are hundreds of websites you can go to and download a simple will form that will be just as useful to you as WillMaker Plus.

I liked the 2009 version.  Unfortunately, starting with the 2010 version, Nolo, the publisher of self-help legal books that produces this software, took away the living trust feature, which was a terrible move.  (Also, you're supposed to upgrade to a new version *every year*.  If you don't, the software won't update itself after the end of the version year -- i.e., Dec. 31, 2011 for the 2011 version -- which can cause problems as states [such as New York] do update their probate and other estate-related laws.)\\n\\nThis 2011 version does not come with the living trust feature, either, but does provide you with a link upon installation to access Nolo's online living trust product for free. This was probably in response to the uproar from their loyal customer base last year. While this does mitigate the problem somewhat -- living trusts are an essential part of estate planning for most people and must be included in an estate toolkit -- it means none of the information you enter in Willmaker Plus 2011, such as all the contact names and addresses and birthdays and phone numbers, carries over to the living trust part, essentially making you have to enter all that information again.\\n\\nOther than that, both the Willmaker itself and the online living trust software are solid estate planning products.  Of course, tools like this are best for simple situations.  How simple?  For example, in my case I'd like to attach a condition to my will that the people I'd like to be the personal custodians for my kids only become custodians if they relocate to my city.  It turns out I cannot do this in Willmaker.  What I have to do is go through the standard Q&A process of Willmaker, export the draft to Word, and then add the condition in Word myself.  This part is easy; the hard -- real hard -- part is I now need to pore over my state's will law to make sure my language is kosher.  I already know the condition itself is fine; I just have to make sure the way I write it -- since Willmaker didnt' write it for me -- will pass on probate.\\n\\nFor most families without complicated familial situations -- such as history of multiple divorces and remarriages or estranged children -- Willmaker Plus 2011 will be good for making wills, living wills (aka healthcare directives), powers of attorney, etc.  You can also write promissory notes and some other simple legal documents beyond wills.\\n\\nAnother thing I'm disappointed with Nolo and this version -- again I think Nolo is using the product as a cash cow rather than to really help its customers -- is it's little changed from the 2009 version, or even the earlier version I had used before.  The same typos (yes, TYPOS!) remain, and the same interface remains.  It seems every year they just change the update-expiration date of the program and the splash screen, and then sell it as a new version.  (And the price seems to have been going up, even though now it doesn't come with living trusts built-in.)  I find this practice unethical.\\n\\nMost likely this will be the last version of Willmaker I'll use.  I wasn't going to use the 2011 version, but got a chance to try it for free, hence I used it and this review.  There're books out there that show you step-by-step how to make wills and living trusts, books published by Nolo and by big-name publishers.  But in the end, I think next time I modify my will or living trust, I'm going to see an estate lawyer -- there are a few reasonable-cost ones in my community.\", 'summary': 'Solid estate planning product, but living trust feature not integrated'}]}\n",

Confusion was the only consistent theme in this application.  Put out by Quicken, the documents are actually created by Nolo, which is a trusted source of legal information.  I\\'d suggest buying their books instead.\\n\\nThe program includes sections on: Buying or Selling a Business; Contracts for Goods and Services; Corporate Minutes and Consents; Forming a Business; Hiring Workers; Leasing Space; LLC Minutes and Consents; Managing Finances; Buying and Selling Real Estate; and Tax Forms.\\n\\nIn these sections, instead of giving you a handy Microsoft Word Document that you can fill in obvious blanks on, the program makes you go through a step by step interview and often doesn\\'t remember the information you enter from one form to another so you must enter your name, the name of the business and so forth all over again.  Nor does it integrate with any contact managers so you can easily fill in from there.  When your interview is complete, the document saves only in text or RTF format, which are highly compatible with most programs but at this point, .doc is pretty standard.\\n\\nMany of the items in these sections are simply Adobe Acrobat forms without the ability to edit or annotate them unless you have something besides Acrobat reader.\\n\\nIncluded in the program are \"checklists\"  that are very short guides on very weighty subjects such as \"How to Form an LLC\" and \"How to Set Up Tax Reporting and Accounting\".  All these checklists do though is point you to other Nolo books or websites and are unable to offer any advice in and of themselves.  In other words, pretty much worthless.\\n\\nMost frustrating to me was the business library which were simple PDFs (or Windows antiquated \"Book Reader\" format of:  Starting & Running a Small Business; Tax Savvy for Small Business; The Manager\\'s Legal Handbook; How to Write a Business Plan; and Business Loans From Family and Friends.  Unfortunately, these books were previous versions and the newest versions of these books (despite the 2011 in the title of the program) are available elsewhere.\\n\\nAdditionally, also included with the program is a printed book called \"Your Little Legal Companion\" that has absolutely nothing to do with business and contains basic personal legal information that borders on the silly such as \"Moving in with your Lover\" and \"Getting Old.\" These tidbits of advice had little substantive or legal value and were more like a sidebar from a Sunday newspaper magazine than anything that could be used for real reference or planning.\\n\\nUpon registering the book, Nolo will send you a PDF of their book \"101 Law Forms for Personal Use\".  Again, this is just a PDF and not any templates that can actually be used within a program.\\n\\nCombined together the program is a good value for all that you are getting.  However if you don\\'t really need all that or want the current versions, I recommend purchasing this collection of eBooks and PDFs individually.', 'summary': 'A bunch of outdated eBooks in a confusing arrangement'}]}\n",

So I\\'ll go ahead and comment on the old version we\\'ve used:\\n\\nFirst, most (probably all) of these forms can be found online for free. The real estate & leasing contracts, for example, can be found on your state realtors web site, or your state\\'s bar association web site. Contracts for goods & services can be found on your state web site (department of motor vehicles for a bill of sale for a car, etc). But if you\\'re like me and don\\'t have time to browse, surf & download, here they are offered on one disc for a pretty reasonable price.\\n\\nI will also add, most of these forms are what you see on Nolo.com, usually on sale for $15-$20 each. So if you\\'ve ever downloaded a form or contract from Nolo, you can get a couple hundred forms here for the price of 2. They claim this contains $900 worth of forms (real estate & leases, bill of sale, service contract & invoicing, paperwork for hiring employees, corporate minutes, IRS tax forms, sample forms for corporate policies, and a few more).\\n\\nAll of that said, this is nowhere near exhaustive - if you are run a fairly straightforward service or contracting business, or are a sole proprietor, this might meet many of your needs. But if you have a corporation (even an LLC), this software is insufficient.\\n\\nI don\\'t really agree with the reviewers who say this will save you legal fees - I don\\'t know anyone who hires a lawyer to write such simple forms. There is nothing here that saved us any legal fees.\\n\\nAlso, none of the forms were usable \"as-is\" for me. Fortunately they can be customized, but I ended up adding huge addendums to any form I used. And, most of these forms are very common, we already had form letters on the computer for most of these topics (we store form letters online for free on our Google Docs account - saves file space, never worry about a crashed hard drive, and any employee can access & download a blank form from anywhere in the world, for free).\\n\\nNonetheless I still give this 3.5 to 4 stars. For me, it\\'s all about saving time. There were a few useful things on here, which saved me an hour or two, so it\\'s not perfect but it deserves a decent rating.', 'summary': 'Really for individuals & small business ...

Note that this copy process is rather slow (if you have more than one DVD drive you can do more than one copy at the same time) and the data are stored in inividual image files for each page so it has to copy around 34,000 files per disk. Each file copy seems to cause the DVD drive to seek back and forth across the disk once, which means 34,000 seeks per disk which slows the process significantly (to over an hour per disk) and also might result in a significant amount of wear and tear on the DVD drive (this is speculation).\\n\\nNote that you\\'ll need 50GB of available disk space if you choose to install all the data to disk!\\n\\nThe developers are actively updating the program and the latest Mac version has a \"copy everything to disk\" feature which does the work for you, and the Windows version should have this same function enabled literally any day now.

Corel requires you to go to their website, sign in and then grab the file. It's not user friendly at all, and I can tell you several of my family members will simply not do it or even remember they have a Corel account. The tutorial videos are fine, but they require flash, which again is another link to an outside website and something several family members are likely going to give-up on <sigh>\\n\\nStill the software itself is handy for shifting to grayscale, cropping your pictures, saving in a ton of different formats.

This combination is only a little more expensive than buying AutoCAD LT alone, so it should be a relatively easy choice for the AutoCAD user who is considering moving into the world if BIM and Revit.\\n\\nHowever Revit LT has a few limitations (as you would expect for being a small fraction of the price of Revit Architecture or any of the other full Revit products). Most notably these are in the areas of collaboration where you\\'re pretty much limited to a single-user workflow (though this seems perfectly reasonable in an \"LT\" version which will probably be used mostly for individual skills development than for production work).\\n\\nThe other annoying limitation is in the area of rendering. Revit LT does not include local rendering so your only way of getting halfway-decent images directly out of it is to use the cloud-rendering service, but the purchase of the program only comes with enough credit to render a few images. Extept that Autodesk have not yet decided how they\\'re going to charge for this service, so it\\'s effectively free without limit for some indeterminate period of time. This all left a somewhat bad taste in my mouth. Can\\'t they even decide what they\\'re going to do? If they want to make it free/bundled then do so rather than seeming to want to get you addicted to a tool that might eventually start costing you as much as a few hundred dollars per week to use.\\n\\nAlso I was pretty unimpressed at the quality of the cloud renderings even in highest quality mode. I would probably just get a copy of VRay if I wanted customer-presentable output.\\n\\nUnfortunately Revit LT does not support plug-ins, so you can\\'t use any of the rendering tools that have nice Revit integration.

This will help you monitor the profitability of each of your jobs and help you stay on track with them, as well as help you see areas for improvement. You will be able to tell if you are receiving your payments and also be able to see when bills are due - allowing you to keep your money in your possession as long as possible.\\n\\nAnd its important to remember that you don't have to use all of these features if they don't apply to your business.

It\\'s pretty annoying after a bit.\\n\\nOne of the catches with this software is that it is auto-renewing. So in order to activate this software, your going to have to give them your credit card number in order to get started. Personally, I feel this is an over-the-top lock-in, so to say. They should be more like your anti-virus subscription, letting you know that your subscription is about to expire, giving YOU the option of renewing instead of them just automatically renewing.\\n\\nSo if you put alot of work and investment into your accounting and inventory, using this software, they kind of have you and your business hostage. So you better know right off the bat if you are ready to make a true commitment to using Sage 50 Accounting software, because that is truly what it is... a commitment!\\n\\nIf you are a small business or very small business, this is probably an investment that you more than likely should avoid, unless you can really work it into your budget and can absolutely commit to using this software. However, if you do not need the the Payroll & Tax software, then this is indeed a good software.

I often need to manage sets of files and WinZip helps with this purpose.\\n\\nThe best way to think about a zip file is as a collection of documents.  Anytime you may hand someone a folder of documents (in business, organizations, etc...) you can think about handling the user a \"zip\" file of the same electronic documents.  When thought of this way, it makes sense to communicate to people with zip files (or folders) instead of collections of documents.  Now, instead of sending people 10 seperate files via email, you can easily organize them into these \"zip\" folders, and then share the compressed file via email.\\n\\nWhile standard Windows/Mac has the ability to compress files (or open them) for free, these solutions have limitations.  For instance, while you can archive a single folder into a zip file, you have to manually repeat this process if you have a batch of folders that need to be individually compressed at once.  The WinZip command-line interface allows you to process batches of files with a single set of commands.\\n\\nIf you company supports them, this software has additional features that aren\\'t supported by Microsoft.  For instance, out-of-the-box MS SharePoint does support the checking-in and checking-out of ZIP files.  This comes in handy where you want to check in a folder of documents, vs a single document.  A properly configured SharePoint sites (where a separate WinZip Express for SharePoint program is installed by an admin), you can utilize zip files for check-in and check-out.\\n\\nThe big question is whether or not to purchase the Standard or Pro (reviewed) version.  From looking at WinZip\\'s website, the main differences deal with the ability to manipulate photos, and in the ability to run automated backups.  If neither of these features are of interest to you, consider saving some money and purchasing the Standard version.\\n\\nIf you regularly use compressed files (or think you could benefit from them), I suggest you 1) download the evaluation copy direct from WinZip, and then 2) buy the software.', 'summary': \"Sometimes built-in (PC or MAC) isn't enough.

Photoshop is an industry standard application for image editing, creative manipulation, compositing and much more. Lightroom is a tool focused on working with digital photographs; cataloging, editing and image enhancement.\\n\\nOver a year ago Adobe implemented their new business model for their creative tools. Instead of selling licenses for their products outright, they went to a subscription model for the majority of their software products. You can choose to pay on a month by month basis for the tools you use, choose a bundle (such as the Photography Plan) or all the tools at once. By paying for a year at a time, the costs can be lowered, and there is an educational discount as well. This decision made for a lot of unhappy users who were used to perpetual licenses. There is some upside though; users benefit from major releases without having to buy the software all over again. Students can actually afford the software for a semester\\'s worth of work. Adobe is able to leverage the connected aspects of Creative Cloud applications for such things as sharing content.\\n\\nPhotoshop is the industry standard software for image work, specifically raster based (as opposed to vector based, which is Illustrator\\'s specialty). This includes common image formats such as jpeg, gif, RAW, png, TIFF, PSD (photoshop\\'s native format). It can even import video. For this release (CC 2014) Adobe wisely chose to not change the look and feel of the software from CS 6. It has the familiar white on dark color scheme. All the tools and menus are pretty much as they have always been. This is good news for long time users.\\n\\nFor those getting started, Photoshop can be a little daunting. Fortunately, there are many resources available in book and online form to help, including Adobe\\'s own excellent videos. The tool set is quite deep. There are drawing tools, there is the type tool and extremely powerful selection tools. Need to separate an object from it\\'s background? There are several ways to do it, and these can be combined. Need to remove an object? Photoshop can pull a magic trick with it\\'s content aware fill tool. It was good in CS 6, and it is improved further in Photoshop CC 2014. As has been always the case, Photoshop\\'s use of layers is an essential feature - allowing for compositing, layering, mattes, layer operations. An extensive list of creative filters are at an artists disposal. There are users who spend years with Photoshop and are still learning new ways to use the software.\\n\\nCC 2014 is an incremental release over CS 6. As has already been said, one would be hard pressed to spot a difference between it and CS 6 just by looking at the screen layout. The differences show up when you dig into the menus. Blur Gallery Motion Effects adds a lot of depth. Upscaling of images has improved. A better Perspective warp. A camera shake reduction that actually works (but still, don\\'t expect miracles for truly bad photos). Creative Cloud Library integration for group work projects.  Photohop CC 2014\\'s 3D tools are even better - now supports 3D printers.  Is it enough for those hanging on to their copies of CS 6 to upgrade? My rule of thumb in years past was to alternate releases. I went from CS 4 to CS 6. CC 2014 feels almost like a CS 7.5.\\n\\nLightroom is Adobe\\'s tool for Photography management and creative work. It has always been a good tool that has steadily improved. It\\'s closest competitor was Apple\\'s Aperture, which Apple has announced is now end of life - to be replaced with a new application called Photos. Adobe has capitalized on this period of uncertainty by offering a tool to import Aperture libraries into Lightroom.\\n\\nLightroom\\'s workflow is to import images, either singly or folders at a time. Editing is non-destructive; the original images are left alone. Once images are imported into a library, the user goes to the \"Develop\" panel to apply image adjustments such as color correction, curves and lens corrections (such as correcting for distortion from a wide angle lens). Tools include spot removal, graduated and radial filters and the adjustment brush (allowing for selective tonality adjustments). Extensive export options are supported, including creating photo books (either as PDF or sent to Blurb), slideshows and Web galleries. The last option is very nicely done, with a fair amount of flexibility in layout including output types (such as Flash or HTML).\\n\\nFor those who are either professional photographers or dedicated amateurs, Lightroom is an excellent tool to have. It should be noted that unlike Photoshop CC, Lightroom can either be \"rented\" through the Creative Cloud, or purchased outright. It is one of the few products left that Adobe sells a license for (Photoshop Elements and Premiere Elements are two others that come to mind).\\n\\nBoth of these tools together represent a fully realized workflow for creative image work. Lightroom handles importing images, cataloging them, adjustments and output. Photoshop adds an extremely powerful creative tool for working with those images combined with other sources. While there are other options, including the free GIMP, both represent the industry standard. For any one interested in graphic design or photographic work, they are near essential.', 'summary': 'Pretty much essential for graphics professionals'}]}\n",

It can be set up to manage direct deposits, print checks and a whole host of small business needs (payroll, inventory, audits, etc.) that I do not require at this point.

What's the difference and why is it important? Allow me to explain:\\n\\nA subscription is like a lease. You pay a set amount of money either monthly or for one year and gain access to something (an apartment, a piece of software) and may use it for the agreed upon amount of time. Once the lease (or the subscription) is terminated, you LOSE your right to use said item. That might be fine for apartments, but much less so for software. You are beholden to the company that created the software forever. If they decide to STOP making the software, you lose your data, and even more importantly, your ability to access and use your previously collected data. Or at least you might, and that's a huge risk for something like accounting data. You might be stuck manually entering years worth of data by hand from printed reports (assuming you have them all).\\n\\nWhen you purchase something, you have several protected rights. One is the right to use what you purchased however you like and for as long as you like (fair use). You also have the right to sell that thing to someone else (First Sale doctrine). With a subscription you have neither of those things, and the lease or subscription holder can take your ability to use the software away from you any time they like. Perhaps they won't, but its an undeniable factor that must be taken into account.\\n\\nAll that said, SAGE and QUICKBOOKS use the same model, so you're not really going to have much choice but to have a subscription if you want a professional accounting software. That's sad, but true. It wasn't always this way, and maybe with enough consumer push back, it won't be this way in the future.\", 'summary': 'SUBSCRIPTION BASED: You do not own this software'}]}\n",

I\\'ve been a Photoshop Elements user for quite a number of years.  I\\'ve always been put off by the way you have to import files and how editing was always a bit of a separate task from editing and cataloging.  AfterShot Pro combines both really well.  It lets you use your native file folder organization directly yet you can still create custom \"collections\" of shots from multiple folders.  Although it has plenty of tagging and keyword capabilities, they aren\\'t quite as straightforward nor are they the main focus in this application.\\n\\nEditing photos is pretty easy with workflow tabs and plenty of easy 1-click types of adjustments.  Of course you can customize the settings in many of these.  As you probably know, software such as AfterShot has less of a focus on preset filters, effects and layers and more on the basic adjustments of lighting, color cast, sharpening and noise reduction.  There\\'s also presets for lens corrections for specific camera models, and additional profiles can be downloaded for free.  Photo effect filter sets can also be purchased and downloaded.  If you want to create your own combinations, these can be set, saved, and then used later - even on multiple files.\\n\\nThat brings me to the next feature set which is really easy and powerful batch editing.  By saving presets, or even choosing the settings from a single picture you\\'ve already edited in AfterShot, you can reapply those same edits and adjustments to other photos.  Every filter and adjustment is saved with the photo and you always have access to this information.\\n\\nThe one thing that does bug me and the main reason for only 4 stars is that the interface can be kind of cluttered and the photo space small on a 1440x900 monitor.  I highly recommend something with more resolution.  Also, every time I applied a filter, even checking or unchecking a preset, I would have to mouse over the image, make a mouse click, or press a keyboard button for the image to redraw.  This can be pretty annoying when you\\'re trying to fine tune sharpening or noise reduction and making lots of small incremental changes.', 'summary': 'Great workflow and balance of power and simplicity.'}]}\n",

# AmazonReviewsFinal2022

#Topic

## For our final project, we decided to look at Amazon Reviews under software products to determine the helpfulness as well as the sentiment of the review. We believe we are moving  into a world where businesses, as well as people, rely heavily on consumer reviews and sentiment to make decisions. We decided to choose this topic to see if we could develop a model that can predict the helpfulness of a review as well as the sentiment associated with the product.
